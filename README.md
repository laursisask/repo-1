## A critical note about production readiness

The IMA is still in active development and therefore should be regarded as _alpha software_. The development is still subject to further security hardening, testing, and breaking changes.

**The proxy contracts have been reviewed and audited by a third-parties for security.**
Please see [SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md) for audit reports and reporting policies.

## Software Architecture

IMA consists of the following three parts:

1)  `Mainnet` smart contracts.
2)  `SKALE Chain` smart contracts.
3)  A containerized [IMA Agent](https://github.com/skalenetwork/ima-agent) application.

Smart contracts are interfaces for any software working with `Mainnet` and `SKALE Chain` like other smart contracts deployed there or software connecting these Ethereum networks.
The Agent is a Node JS application connecting the smart contracts on Mainnet with SKALE Chains.

## Components Structure

### Proxy

IMA proxy is the Solidity part of IMA containing `Mainnet` and `SKALE Chain` smart contracts.
